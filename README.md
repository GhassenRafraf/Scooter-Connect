# Scooter Connect ‚Äì Embedded System Firmware

**Portfolio Project Overview**

This repository documents the **embedded firmware architecture** designed for the Scooter Connect project. The firmware was developed to run on an **ESP32-WROVER-E** and provides **real-time scooter connectivity, ride telemetry acquisition, and BLE communication** with a companion mobile application.

## üéØ Functional Scope

The embedded system acts as the **core connectivity and sensing unit** of the scooter. Its main functions are:

- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** communication with the mobile app
- **GPS integration** via AT commands for ride tracking
- **IMU integration** for motion and orientation sensing
- **Real-time coordination** using a FreeRTOS-based task architecture
- **Data delivery** to the app in a structured format for visualization and storage

## üèóÔ∏è High-Level Firmware Architecture

The firmware is designed with a **layered modular structure**, separating hardware abstraction, system orchestration, and application logic:

### **Board Support Package (BSP) Module**
- Provides hardware abstraction for UART, I¬≤C, SPI, GPIO, timers, and power control
- Encapsulates low-level drivers for peripherals such as the GNSS module and IMU sensors
- Ensures portability by isolating hardware-specific code

### **System Manager Module**
- Built on FreeRTOS, manages task creation, queues, and inter-task notifications
- Coordinates data flow between GPS, IMU, and BLE Manager tasks
- Implements resource management (e.g., memory allocation, synchronization)
- Serves as the central orchestrator of runtime behavior

### **Application Logic Module**
- Defines the functional behavior of the scooter connectivity system
- Aggregates sensor data into telemetry frames
- Implements communication protocols for BLE exchange with the mobile app
- Prepares structured data for higher-level application use (e.g., visualization, analytics)

## FreeRTOS Task Model

The application module is structured into **independent tasks**:

#### **BLE Manager Task**
- Manages pairing, connections, and GATT data exchange with the mobile app
- Receives aggregated telemetry frames from the coordinator

#### **GPS Task**
- Interfaces with the GNSS module over UART using AT commands
- Parses **NMEA sentences** and `AT+CGNSSINFO` responses
- Provides structured `GPSData` objects via a FreeRTOS queue

#### **IMU Task**
- Samples accelerometer and gyroscope data
- Delivers `IMUData` objects to the central coordinator

#### **Central Coordinator Task**
- Collects GPS and IMU data from queues
- Aggregates telemetry into unified packets
- Notifies the BLE Manager when data is ready for transmission

### üß© Example Data Flow

1. **GPS Task** parses a new NMEA sentence and pushes `GPSData` to a queue
2. **IMU Task** samples orientation data and pushes `IMUData` to a queue
3. **Central Coordinator** aggregates the data into a telemetry frame
4. **Coordinator** signals the BLE Manager via task notification
5. **BLE Manager** transmits the telemetry packet to the mobile app


## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
